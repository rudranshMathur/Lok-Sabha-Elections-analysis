With co-realtion and CHI-square we find out if there is any realtion between majority/minority and result.
We converted parties names to just INDIA and NDA marking them as 0 and 1 respetively.
We got a negative corelation value of -0.151152 indicating weak linear relationship between them.

For CHI-square:
  Null Hypothesis (ùêª0): The majority to minority ratio is independent of the winning party.
  Alternative Hypothesis (ùêª1): The majority to minority ratio is not independent of the winning party.

We got p = 0.11 which is greater then 0.05, so null hypothesis is accepted. It means that dominace of major in a State does not affect the party it chooses generally.
